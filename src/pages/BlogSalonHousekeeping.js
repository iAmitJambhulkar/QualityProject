                                Simple vacuuming or brooming is insufficient. To keep your salon looking pleasant and appealing, you 
                                occasionally require expert cleaning. The salon is made to appear larger and more luxurious by adding 
                                additional mirrors, but with time, frequent foot traffic and product spills from beauty treatments can 
                                detract from the salon's attractiveness and opulence.

                                Why is it crucial to uphold hygienic standards in a beauty salon?

                                To reduce the possibility of cross-contamination, your salon must maintain high levels of hygiene. If you 
                                don't do your part to stop them from spreading, fungus, viruses, parasites, and germs can easily come from 
                                you, other clients, or unclean instruments.
                            </p>
                            <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.8', color: '#555', marginTop: '20px' }}>
                                Tools like combs, scissors, and tweezers are excellent candidates for cross-contamination. Additionally, 
                                your clients would feel a bit uncomfortable if they found out that you used the same scissors on all of them 
                                without washing them. This makes it easy for germs to travel between clients and can result in diseases that 
                                make it highly unlikely that they would employ your services again.
                            </p>

                                The floor of your salon needs to be kept clean at all times because of the constant foot traffic it receives. 
                                It is important to remove any debris as soon as possible, such as hair that has gathered around your cutting 
                                area or flyaway nail extensions, not only to prevent slips and trips but also to stop bacteria from spreading
