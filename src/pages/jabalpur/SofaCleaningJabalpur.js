                                replaced. Over time, sofas tend to get dirtier with kids spilling food, ink, and crumps of food getting 
                                stuck in between the corners.

                                Sofas are usually made of fur and fabrics that are more prone to accumulating dirt. Herein, mere dusting 
                                does not help in completely cleaning the sofa. This requires deep cleaning that not only helps in cleaning 
                                the corners and ends from even minutest dirt and dust but also assists in restoring the original appearance 
                                to the sofa.

                                Different sofas are made of different fabrics. Besides, each fabric requires unique treatment, and hence 
                                having a good understanding of the material can help in carrying out appropriate cleaning. Herein, cleaning 
                                the sofa using any equipment can spoil the material and lead to complications leaving tears and removal of 
                                foams.

                                Germs have the capacity of infiltrating to the deepest parts of the furniture and sofas wherein they breed

                                Besides, the foamy interior parts of the sofa tend to attract more germs and pathogens from liquid, food, 
                                and surroundings. These later form stains and spots that are extremely stubborn to get removed.
